What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
I think my initial impressions of unit tests were that it was very helpful - partly because my CS 110 class also used testsuites that we could use to test our code so the idea of assertions and assertion errors wasn't new to me and it was really cool to get to actually build them and see the many different kinds and how they worked. 
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Overcomplicating assertions doesn't work even though the way we're doing it might not seem complex ,it's still best to keep things as simple as possible.
